After the End - Deposed - Official Unofficial 4chan Fan Fork Fork (AtEDOU4cFFF) (Name Pending)

Changelog for version 0.3 (May 20, 2024):
	- Incorporated bugfix in afterend_decisions.txt that prevents non-cetic emperors from visiting their own court.
	  Thank you, anon 1281614, for this bugfix.
	- Gertrude Stoklasa should now actually be unmarried.
	- Removed the last bit of the Woolleyite Mormon heresy that I missed the last time around.
	- Fixed the Abbot of Herman's Brotherhood (The Nazarene Head of Faith) from going Feudal upon succession. This was 
	  supposed to have been fixed in AtE FF 1.2a, but it wasn't implemented. The Nazarene Head of Faith should now always 
	  be Theocratic.
	- Fixed the High Priest of the Atomic Priesthood (The Aphite Head of Faith) from going Open Range Feudalism (ORF). 
	  The Aphite Head of Faith should now always be Theocratic.
	- Changed the religion of Fraser Littlefield, a previous High Priest of the Atomic Priesthood (The Aphite Head of 
	  Faith) from Atomicist to Aphite, as he was the Aphite High Priest.
	- Commented out a line (true_religion_thelemic_trigger = yes) in 00_societies.txt as it was referencing a non-existent 
	  trigger.
	- Added placeholder event pictures to many events in orf_election_events.txt.
	- Commented out two triggered-only events ("orfelection.23" and "orfelection.24") in orf_election_events.txt as their 
	  trigger in a previous event (An option in "orfelection.4") was already commented out.
	- Fixed two event picture names (In events "fide.125" and "fide.128") in mex_misc.txt. They had the wrong names and 
	  weren't referencing actual pictures.
	- Fixed two event picture names (In events "hanovers.11" and "hanovers.13") in hanover_events.txt. They had the wrong 
	  names and weren't referencing actual pictures.
	- Added placeholder event pictures to two events ("texas.49" and "texas.75") in texas_events.txt as they were missing.
	- Commented out two references to a non-existent trait (party_malcontent) in 01_pragmatist.txt and 04_malcontent.txt.
	- Added a placeholder event picture to event redland.1 in event file redland_events.txt.
	- Changed a line in event "mictlan.10" in file mictlantec_events.txt from "cash = -100" to "wealth = -100", as it was 
	  the wrong command.
	- In the 00_on_actions.txt file, under the on_death section, event "orfelection.102" was commented out as that event 
	  doesn't actually exist.
	- Both references to event "AMLT.1" in the 00_on_actions.txt file were commented out, as that event was already 
	  commented out in am_lt_events.txt.
	- The Mouse artifact "Cursed Apple of the Snow White Princess" had a non-functioning modifier (insane_opinion = 3) 
	  removed. To compensate for this, it now gives 1 Intrigue.
	- Chief Johnathan Nyukem of Esmeralda Pass county now has the "Strong" trait and the "Old World Shades" artifact. He 
	  was also given the "diversity" and "physique" character flags to prevent randomization of his race and physique.
	- Fixed (Maybe?) event "destape.8" in mex_imperial_succession_events.txt.
	- Fixed (Maybe?) event "mictlan.50" in mictlantec_events.txt.
	- Fixed any previous Abbot of Herman's Brotherhood (The Nazarene Head of Faith) from becoming unlanded upon death, 
	  though this comes at a loss of any new Abbot having a dynasty. However, now every new Abbot will start with one of 
	  the three unique Nazarene traits (Seraph, Acolyte and Presbyter). New Abbots will also start about 20 years older, 
	  similar to how they were before. In addition, this fix now allows the Abbot to transfer their wealth and any 
	  artifacts they have to their successor, as previously both their wealth and artifacts disappeared on succession, 
	  leaving their successor with nothing. Also, now Nazarene characters will be notified of the Abbot's death via a 
	  High Priority Message like other Heads of Faith, this was not the case previously for some reason. This fix 
	  involved editing event "nazarene.2" in the file nazarene_events.txt and moving "nazarene.2" in the on_actions.txt 
	  file from the "on_death" section to the "on_new_holder_inheritance" section.
	- Fixed Senor Friedrich of Cuauhtemoc's (Under the Estado of Chihuahua in Sierra Madre) dynasty from Unger to Insbern, 
	  as it was in a previous version. His children now also have the Insbern dynasty, as it used to be. His father is 
	  also now Jeremias Insbern, fixing the Insbern family tree.
	- Cristina Caballero, princess of Baja, has had her ethnicity changed to "Mediterranean", to match the rest of her 
	  family. Her culture is still "Californiano", however.
	- Subprefect Mark Aurelio of Orange county has had his ethnicity changed to "Mediterranean", his culture will remain 
	  "Angeleno", however.
	- Subprefect Arthur Douglas of Oceanside county and his family members have had their ethnicities changed to "White", 
	  while their culture will remain "Angeleno".
	- Subprefect Rock Douglas of Blythe county and his deceased father, Stone Douglas, have had their religion changed to 
	  "Nazarene" to match the religion of their county. They no longer have the cetic trait "Way of the Fist", but now 
	  have the "Wroth" trait in its place. Their ethnicity and culture will remain unchanged.
	- Elizabeth Cameron, the old High Queen of Texas, has been deposed and replaced with George Hillwalker, a reference to 
	  George Dubya, Walker, Texas Ranger, Hank Hill from King of the Hill and General George Hammond (of Texas) from 
	  Stargate SG-1. Thank you, Chilean anon, for the idea of changing his dynasty name from Walker to Hillwalker.
	- All references to the old High Queen in the file am_tex_flavor.csv have been replaced with references to the High 
	  King. Some minor spelling and grammatical errors have also been fixed.
	- The line "princely_elective_apply_elector_setup_effect = yes" in the file empire_decisions.txt has been commented 
	  out, as it was referencing an already commented out section in file 00_scripted_effects.txt. This was under the 
	  "Form Texarkana" decision. It will still give the holder Princely or HRE Elective Succession on creation without it.
	- The "Northlander" culture has had various names restored to it. Thank you, Chilean anon.
	- The "Bagley" dynasty has had its original name restored to "Venable". Thank you, Chilean anon.

	- The "Tonton Macoutes" mercenary company has been restored. Thank you, Chilean anon. They won't replace the existing 
	  "Vieux Lions" mercenary company, but will exist alongside them.
	- Fixed a minor spelling error in the "Reunite the Kingdom of Illinois" decision in the file 00_am_events3.csv.
	- Fixed the province of Kaskaskia in the duchy of The Gateway having the wrong name of Kaskasia.
	- The old Kingom of Carolina in the HCC has been restored. However, it can only be formed by decision if you 
	  completely control the duchies under the kingdoms of Tarheel and Palmetto while being independent. This will change 
	  the dejure liege of these duchies to the Kingdom of Carolina, leaving the Kingdoms of Tarheel and Palmetto titular. 
	  Thank you, Chilean anon, for the idea and flag. Thank you, anon 1756033, for the idea of replacing the two old 
	  kingdoms with Carolina as the goal.

	  removal of the Abbas rulers in Deposed version 0.2.

	- Gave the "Hillwalker" dynasty (The High King of Texas) a modified flag of Texas as their CoA.
	- The barony of Clearwater in Tampa has been activated.
	- Added a new religion: Scientology. It's barebones at the moment, but it now exists. It's a small, hard to convert 
	  and aggressive religion that can raid infidel neighbors for loot. Scientology's Holy Sites are: Riverside, 
	  Los Angeles, San Francisco, Las Vegas and Tampa. Their head of faith is the Chairman of the Board of the Church of 
	  Scientology. With this addition, come characters practicing this religion. There are now 4 landed Scientologists,

	  extra wealth because Scientology.

	  "Maverick" Mitchell (Top Gun). He is White in ethnicity, Angeleno in culture, and Scientologist in religion.
	- Tarl Travego now holds the barony of Clearwater in Tampa. He is a reference to John Travolta and some of his more 
	  famous film roles. His first name Tarl comes from Terl (Battlefield Earth) and his last name is a portmanteau of 
	  Travolta, Tony Manero (Saturday Night Fever) and Vincent Vega (Pulp Fiction). He is Gulfard in culture and 
	  Scientologist in religion.
	- With the addition of Scientology comes "Sea Org", Scientology's sole holy order.
	- Added lines for the "Knights of the Golden Circle", "Vieux Lions" (As the line for the "Tonton Macoutes" was left in 
	  here after they were removed everywhere else, but the "Vieux Lions" weren't added here to replace it), and "Sea Org" 
	  to the file HF_alternate_start_events.txt. This only affects Alternate Starts in Shattered or Random worlds.
