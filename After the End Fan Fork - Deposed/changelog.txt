After the End - Deposed - Official Unofficial 4chan Fan Fork Fork (AtEDOU4cFFF) (Name Pending)

Changelog for version 0.3.1 (?? ??, 202?):
	- Added in descendants of the High King of Texas, George Hillwalker. There's now an unbroken line of Hillwalkers in 
	  the history of Metroplex, from George Hillwalker down to Hank Hillwalker.
	- Hank Hillwalker now rules the Duchy of Metroplex from Dallas county. He's descended from the High King of Texas, 
	  George Hillwalker. Hank and his family are Texan in culture and Catholic in religion. However, his father, Cotton 
	  Hillwalker, is Americanist in religion. Hank's half-brother, Junichiro, is Edokko in culture and Shinto in religion. 
	  The family is a reference to King of the Hill. As a result of this, the previous Duke of Metroplex, Denton Wise, has
	  been deposed and is now a courtier in Hank's court.
	- Added in 50 characters of Edokko culture and Shinto religion killed by Cotton Hillwalker in the past.
	- Fixed the "expel_salvation_army" decision in holy_order_decisions.txt. The decision was referencing the 
	  "expel_round_table_check" character flag, rather than the "expel_salvation_army_check" character flag. Thank you to 
	  Monetarist anon for this fix.
	- Added Christian Weston Chandler. He is currently a courtier of George Bannister, the Count of Charlottesville.
	  Christian is an immortal lunatic that's Southron in culture and Evangelical in religion. More content for him may be 
	  added at a later date.
	- Gilbert Fontaine de la Tour Dauterive now rules the County of St. Landry under the Kingdom of Louisiana. He and his 
	  family are all references to the Dauterive family from King of the Hill. Gilbert has just recently succeeded his 
	  father Alphonse as the Count of St. Landry, and his family is dying out, with himself and his depressed cousin 
	  William being the only male Dauterives alive, they are the only ones able to carry on the name. All members of the 
	  Dauterive family are Cajun in culture and Catholic in religion. However, the family publicly practices the Voodoo 
	  faith while having to prectice the Catholic faith in secret.
	- The creation critera for the Monetarist Caliph (In the "d_monetarist" section of the "landed_titles/religious.txt" 
	  file) has been fixed so that it works properly. Thanks again to Monetarist anon for this fix.
	- The Hillwalker Coat of Arms has been slightly altered to include the Strickland Propane star.
	- More King of the Hill characters have been added to Hank Hillwalker's court. These include the Platter and 
	  Souphanousinphone families.
	- Dale Gribble now rules the County of Somervell as a vassal to Duke Hank of Metroplex. Joining him are his wife 
	  Nancy, his son Joeseph, his father Bug Gribble, and Johnathan Redcorn. The Gribble family is Texan in culture and 
	  Catholic in religion. Johnathan Redcorn is Muscogee in culture and Peyotist in religion.
	- Jeffrey Boomhauer III now rules the County of Texoma as a vassal to Duke Hank of Metroplex. Joining him are his 
	  mother Clara, his brother Patch and his grandmother Meemaw. The Boomhauer family is Texan in culture and Catholic in 
	  religion.
	- Certain aspects of the members of the Texan Black Jack family, located in the court of the First Cavalry, have been 
	  changed. Alexander and his wife Penny (Who's now been renamed to Violet.) no longer have the "Bright" nickname. 
	  Elizabeth Black Jack no longer has the "Appletree" nickname. Macintosh Black Jack has been renamed to Amos. 
	  Michelle has been renamed to Isabelle. The three living Black Jack family members (Elizabeth, Amos and Isabelle) 
	  have had their stats adjusted and extra traits have been added (Including education traits, as they were absent 
	  before).
	- Allison Maverick, Duchess of the First Cavalry, has been significantly changed to be a reference to Samuel Augustus 
	  Maverick, a signer of the Texas Declaration of Independence. The character is now male and named Augustus Maverick. 
	  His stats and traits were slightly edited. Allison's previously husband, Morgan Steincutter has also been 
	  significantly changed to be a reference to Mary Ann Adams Maverick, an early Texas pioneer, author, and wife of 
	  Samuel Augustus Maverick. The character is now female and named Annabelle. Her stats and traits were edited and her 
	  culture is now Texan.
	- The Maverick dynasty now has the IRL CoA of Samuel Maverick, one of the earliest settlers in Massachusetts, and 
	  ancestor of Samuel Augustus Maverick.
	- Added a Kennedy dynasty with the IRL CoA of John F. Kennedy. The dynasty is of Yankee culture and is currently 
	  unused, but members will be added in soon.
	- 

Changelog for version 0.3 (May 20, 2024):
	- Incorporated bugfix in afterend_decisions.txt that prevents non-cetic emperors from visiting their own court.
	  Thank you, anon 1281614, for this bugfix.
	- Gertrude Stoklasa should now actually be unmarried.
	- Removed the last bit of the Woolleyite Mormon heresy that I missed the last time around.
	- Fixed the Abbot of Herman's Brotherhood (The Nazarene Head of Faith) from going Feudal upon succession. This was 
	  supposed to have been fixed in AtE FF 1.2a, but it wasn't implemented. The Nazarene Head of Faith should now always 
	  be Theocratic.
	- Fixed the High Priest of the Atomic Priesthood (The Aphite Head of Faith) from going Open Range Feudalism (ORF). 
	  The Aphite Head of Faith should now always be Theocratic.
	- Changed the religion of Fraser Littlefield, a previous High Priest of the Atomic Priesthood (The Aphite Head of 
	  Faith) from Atomicist to Aphite, as he was the Aphite High Priest.
	- Commented out a line (true_religion_thelemic_trigger = yes) in 00_societies.txt as it was referencing a non-existent 
	  trigger.
	- Added placeholder event pictures to many events in orf_election_events.txt.
	- Commented out two triggered-only events ("orfelection.23" and "orfelection.24") in orf_election_events.txt as their 
	  trigger in a previous event (An option in "orfelection.4") was already commented out.
	- Fixed two event picture names (In events "fide.125" and "fide.128") in mex_misc.txt. They had the wrong names and 
	  weren't referencing actual pictures.
	- Fixed two event picture names (In events "hanovers.11" and "hanovers.13") in hanover_events.txt. They had the wrong 
	  names and weren't referencing actual pictures.
	- Added placeholder event pictures to two events ("texas.49" and "texas.75") in texas_events.txt as they were missing.
	- Commented out two references to a non-existent trait (party_malcontent) in 01_pragmatist.txt and 04_malcontent.txt.
	- Added a placeholder event picture to event redland.1 in event file redland_events.txt.
	- Changed a line in event "mictlan.10" in file mictlantec_events.txt from "cash = -100" to "wealth = -100", as it was 
	  the wrong command.
	- In the 00_on_actions.txt file, under the on_death section, event "orfelection.102" was commented out as that event 
	  doesn't actually exist.
	- Both references to event "AMLT.1" in the 00_on_actions.txt file were commented out, as that event was already 
	  commented out in am_lt_events.txt.
	- The Mouse artifact "Cursed Apple of the Snow White Princess" had a non-functioning modifier (insane_opinion = 3) 
	  removed. To compensate for this, it now gives 1 Intrigue.
	- Chief Johnathan Nyukem of Esmeralda Pass county now has the "Strong" trait and the "Old World Shades" artifact. He 
	  was also given the "diversity" and "physique" character flags to prevent randomization of his race and physique.
	- Fixed (Maybe?) event "destape.8" in mex_imperial_succession_events.txt.
	- Fixed (Maybe?) event "mictlan.50" in mictlantec_events.txt.
	- Fixed any previous Abbot of Herman's Brotherhood (The Nazarene Head of Faith) from becoming unlanded upon death, 
	  though this comes at a loss of any new Abbot having a dynasty. However, now every new Abbot will start with one of 
	  the three unique Nazarene traits (Seraph, Acolyte and Presbyter). New Abbots will also start about 20 years older, 
	  similar to how they were before. In addition, this fix now allows the Abbot to transfer their wealth and any 
	  artifacts they have to their successor, as previously both their wealth and artifacts disappeared on succession, 
	  leaving their successor with nothing. Also, now Nazarene characters will be notified of the Abbot's death via a 
	  High Priority Message like other Heads of Faith, this was not the case previously for some reason. This fix 
	  involved editing event "nazarene.2" in the file nazarene_events.txt and moving "nazarene.2" in the on_actions.txt 
	  file from the "on_death" section to the "on_new_holder_inheritance" section.
	- Fixed Senor Friedrich of Cuauhtemoc's (Under the Estado of Chihuahua in Sierra Madre) dynasty from Unger to Insbern, 
	  as it was in a previous version. His children now also have the Insbern dynasty, as it used to be. His father is 
	  also now Jeremias Insbern, fixing the Insbern family tree.
	- Cristina Caballero, princess of Baja, has had her ethnicity changed to "Mediterranean", to match the rest of her 
	  family. Her culture is still "Californiano", however.
	- Subprefect Mark Aurelio of Orange county has had his ethnicity changed to "Mediterranean", his culture will remain 
	  "Angeleno", however.
	- Subprefect Arthur Douglas of Oceanside county and his family members have had their ethnicities changed to "White", 
	  while their culture will remain "Angeleno".
	- Subprefect Rock Douglas of Blythe county and his deceased father, Stone Douglas, have had their religion changed to 
	  "Nazarene" to match the religion of their county. They no longer have the cetic trait "Way of the Fist", but now 
	  have the "Wroth" trait in its place. Their ethnicity and culture will remain unchanged.
	- Elizabeth Cameron, the old High Queen of Texas, has been deposed and replaced with George Hillwalker, a reference to 
	  George Dubya, Walker, Texas Ranger, Hank Hill from King of the Hill and General George Hammond (of Texas) from 
	  Stargate SG-1. Thank you, Chilean anon, for the idea of changing his dynasty name from Walker to Hillwalker.
	- All references to the old High Queen in the file am_tex_flavor.csv have been replaced with references to the High 
	  King. Some minor spelling and grammatical errors have also been fixed.
	- The line "princely_elective_apply_elector_setup_effect = yes" in the file empire_decisions.txt has been commented 
	  out, as it was referencing an already commented out section in file 00_scripted_effects.txt. This was under the 
	  "Form Texarkana" decision. It will still give the holder Princely or HRE Elective Succession on creation without it.
	- The "Northlander" culture has had various names restored to it. Thank you, Chilean anon.

	  "Vieux Lions" mercenary company, but will exist alongside them.

	- Fixed the province of Kaskaskia in the duchy of The Gateway having the wrong name of Kaskasia.
	- The old Kingom of Carolina in the HCC has been restored. However, it can only be formed by decision if you 
	  completely control the duchies under the kingdoms of Tarheel and Palmetto while being independent. This will change 
	  the dejure liege of these duchies to the Kingdom of Carolina, leaving the Kingdoms of Tarheel and Palmetto titular. 
	  Thank you, Chilean anon, for the idea and flag. Thank you, anon 1756033, for the idea of replacing the two old 
	  kingdoms with Carolina as the goal.

	- Gave the "Hillwalker" dynasty (The High King of Texas) a modified flag of Texas as their CoA.
	- The barony of Clearwater in Tampa has been activated.
	- Added a new religion: Scientology. It's barebones at the moment, but it now exists. It's a small, hard to convert 
	  and aggressive religion that can raid infidel neighbors for loot. Scientology's Holy Sites are: Riverside, 
	  Los Angeles, San Francisco, Las Vegas and Tampa. Their head of faith is the Chairman of the Board of the Church of 
	  Scientology. With this addition, come characters practicing this religion. There are now 4 landed Scientologists,

	  extra wealth because Scientology.

	  "Maverick" Mitchell (Top Gun). He is White in ethnicity, Angeleno in culture, and Scientologist in religion.
	- Tarl Travego now holds the barony of Clearwater in Tampa. He is a reference to John Travolta and some of his more 
	  famous film roles. His first name Tarl comes from Terl (Battlefield Earth) and his last name is a portmanteau of 
	  Travolta, Tony Manero (Saturday Night Fever) and Vincent Vega (Pulp Fiction). He is Gulfard in culture and 
	  Scientologist in religion.
	- With the addition of Scientology comes "Sea Org", Scientology's sole holy order.
	- Added lines for the "Knights of the Golden Circle", "Vieux Lions" (As the line for the "Tonton Macoutes" was left in 
	  here after they were removed everywhere else, but the "Vieux Lions" weren't added here to replace it), and "Sea Org" 
	  to the file HF_alternate_start_events.txt. This only affects Alternate Starts in Shattered or Random worlds.
