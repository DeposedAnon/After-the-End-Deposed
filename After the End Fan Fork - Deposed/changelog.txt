	  the history of Metroplex, from George Hillwalker down to Hank Hillwalker.
	  
	- Hank Hillwalker now rules the Duchy of Metroplex from Dallas county. He's descended from the High King of Texas, 
	  George Hillwalker. Hank and his family are Texan in culture and Catholic in religion. However, his father, Cotton 
	  Hillwalker, is Americanist in religion. Hank's half-brother, Junichiro, is Edokko in culture and Shinto in religion. 
	  The family is a reference to King of the Hill. As a result of this, the previous Duke of Metroplex, Denton Wise, has
	  been deposed and is now a courtier in Hank's court.
	  
	- Added in 50 characters of Edokko culture and Shinto religion killed by Cotton Hillwalker in the past.
	
	- Fixed the "expel_salvation_army" decision in holy_order_decisions.txt. The decision was referencing the

	  Monetarist anon for this fix.
	  
	- Added Christian Weston Chandler. He is currently a courtier of George Bannister, the Count of Charlottesville.
	  Christian is an immortal lunatic that's Southron in culture and Evangelical in religion. More content for him may be

	- Gilbert Fontaine de la Tour Dauterive now rules the County of St. Landry under the Kingdom of Louisiana. He and his 
	  family are all references to the Dauterive family from King of the Hill. Gilbert has just recently succeeded his 
	  father Alphonse as the Count of St. Landry, and his family is dying out, with himself and his depressed cousin 
	  William being the only male Dauterives alive, they are the only ones able to carry on the name. All members of the 
	  Dauterive family are Cajun in culture and Catholic in religion. However, the family publicly practices the Voodoo 
	  faith while having to prectice the Catholic faith in secret.
	  
	- The creation critera for the Monetarist Caliph (In the "d_monetarist" section of the "landed_titles/religious.txt" 
	  file) has been fixed so that it works properly. Thanks again to Monetarist anon for this fix.
	  
	- The Hillwalker Coat of Arms has been slightly altered to include the Strickland Propane star.
	
	- More King of the Hill characters have been added to Hank Hillwalker's court. These include the Platter and 
	  Souphanousinphone families.
	  
	- Dale Gribble now rules the County of Somervell as a vassal of Duke Hank of Metroplex. Joining him are his wife 
	  Nancy, his son Joeseph, his father Bug Gribble, and Johnathan Redcorn. The Gribble family is Texan in culture and 
	  Catholic in religion. Johnathan Redcorn is Muscogee in culture and Peyotist in religion.
	  
	- Jeffrey Boomhauer III now rules the County of Texoma as a vassal of Duke Hank of Metroplex. Joining him are his 
	  mother Clara, his brother Patch and his grandmother Meemaw. The Boomhauer family is Texan in culture and Catholic in

	  Elizabeth Black Jack no longer has the "Appletree" nickname. Macintosh Black Jack has been renamed to Amos. 
	  Michelle has been renamed to Isabelle. The three living Black Jack family members (Elizabeth, Amos and Isabelle) 
	  have had their stats adjusted and extra traits have been added (Including education traits, as they were absent 
	  before).
	  
	- Allison Maverick, Duchess of the First Cavalry, has been significantly changed to be a reference to Samuel Augustus 
	  Maverick, a signer of the Texas Declaration of Independence. The character is now male and named Augustus Maverick. 
	  His stats and traits were slightly edited. Allison's previously husband, Morgan Steincutter has also been 
	  significantly changed to be a reference to Mary Ann Adams Maverick, an early Texas pioneer, author, and wife of 
	  Samuel Augustus Maverick. The character is now female and named Annabelle. Her stats and traits were edited and her 
	  culture is now Texan. Augustus Maverick and Hank Hillwalker are now rivals, due to Augustus' parents dying in battle 
	  against Hank some years prior to the start date.
	  
	- The Maverick dynasty now has the IRL CoA of Samuel Maverick, one of the earliest settlers in Massachusetts, and 
	  ancestor of Samuel Augustus Maverick.
	  
	- Added a Kennedy dynasty with the IRL CoA of John F. Kennedy. The dynasty is of Yankee culture and is currently 
	  unused, but members will be added in soon.
	  
	- In the "interface/coats_of_arms/coats_of_arms.txt" file, the number of frames for the "deposed_dynasties.tga" 
	  section has been increased to 50. Thank you, to Chileanon (Previously referred to as "Chilean anon") for this.
	  
	- Likewise, the "gfx/coats_of_arms/deposed_dynasties.tga" file itself has had it's number of frames increased to 50. 
	  Thank you again, to Chileanon.
	  
	- Terrence "Godspeaker" Davis now rules the County of Des Plaines as a vassal of Duke Robert II of Cook. He is a 
	  reference to the late Terry A. Davis (RIP), creator and designer of TempleOS. The Davis dynasty has a modified 
	  TempleOS logo as its CoA. Terrence Davis is Chicagoan in culture and Catholic in religion. His location and culture 
	  may be changed at a later date to be more accurate. Thank you to Chileanon for this, especially the Davis dynasty 
	  CoA.
	  
	- William Francis Rockwell now rules the country of Streatorland as a vassal of Queen Amanda of Illinois. He is an 
	  amalgamation of (and a reference to) three American fascists; William Luther Pierce, Francis Parker Yockey and 
	  George Lincoln Rockwell. He also serves as a reference to "Illinois Nazis" (The Blues Brothers, and the US Supreme 
	  Court case of the National Socialist Party of America v. Village of Skokie). The Rockwell dynasty has the CoA of 
	  House Salas from Chileanon's fork of the Sob o Anil mod. William Francis Rockwell is Rostmann in culture and 
	  Catholic in religion. Thank you to Chileanon for this.
	  
	- Earl Long now rules the counties of Kisatchie, Natchitoches and Rapides as a vassal of Duke Pierre of Alexandria, 
	  in the Kingdom of Louisiana. He is a descendant of Grand Prince Huey "the Kingfish" of Louisiana, who himself is a 
	  reference to the IRL Huey Long, 40th governor of Louisiana and later a US Senator who was assassinated while still 
	  in office. Earl Long is the last in a long of of descendants of Huey Long, and is Dixie in culture and Catholic in 
	  religion. However, he and his deceased family members publicly practice the Voodoo faith while having to practice 
	  the Catholic faith in secret. The Long dynasty CoA has also been changed to that of the eagle from the American 
	  Union State flag from Kaiserreich, edited by Chileanon. Thank you to Chileanon for this.
	  
	- Fixed the "declare_kingdom_of_tarheel" decision in the file "decisions/HFP_realm_decisions.txt". The required 
	  provinces were incorrectly referencing the provinces for the Kingdom of Magnolia. This has been fixed and they now 
	  properly reference the provinces for the Kingdom of Tarheel. The duchy of Cape Fear was also incorrectly becoming 
	  dejure to the Grand Duchy of Tarheel. It has been fixed to now become dejure to the Kingdom of Tarheel like the 
	  other duchies. Thank you to Monetarist anon for bringing attention to this bug.
	  
	- Fixed the "declare_kingdom_of_magnolia" decision in the file "decisions/HFP_realm_decisions.txt". The duchies of 
	  Magnolia were incorrectly becoming dejure to the Archduchy of Magnolia. This has been fixed and they now become 
	  dejure to the Kingdom of Magnolia like intended. Thank you to Monetarist anon for bringing attention to this bug.
	  
	- Fixed a small bug in the "declare_kingdom_of_georgia" decision in the file "decisions/HFP_realm_decisions.txt". 
	  The decision was incorrectly copying the player's previous title laws to the Kingdom of Tuskegee. The decision now 
	  properly copies the player's previous title laws to the Kingdom of Georgia.
	  
	- High Chief Melis Dachs of the Badgerlings is now Catholic, having converted five years prior to the start date. His 
	  stats and traits have also been adjusted. He also now has a family, his parents and four siblings. Of his family, 
	  only he and his two youngest sisters are Catholic. His mother, brother, oldest sister and deceased father are Norse. 
	  The provinces of The Dells and Four Lakes are also now Catholic in religion. His brother, Martin Dachs, now rules 
	  the counties of Portage and Puckaway as his vassal.
	  
	- Added in two unique artifacts for Christian Weston Chandler: "The True and Honest Sonichu Medallion", and "The Sonic
	  Totem". Currently, they require the owner to have either the "Lunatic" or "Reclusive" traits to be used, but this may 
	  be changed in the future. Events for these artifacts may also be added in the future. Generic versions of these two 
	  artifacts may also be added in the future. Thank you to anon 1784366 for the texture files.
	
	- Added the "Memphis Pyramid" Great Work in Memphis. This is a direct reference to the Bass Pro Shops Pyramid in 
	  Memphis, Tennessee.
	  
	- The following Great Works have had their images resized so they fit properly into the Great Work box: "Hoover Dam" 
	  in Las Vegas, "Alamo Fortress" in San Antonio, "Mt. Rushmore" in Rushmore, "Capitol" in Washington and "Castillo de 
	  Chapultepec" in Mexico.
	  
	- The "Lady Liberty" Great Work in Palisades has had its image replaced with one that's cleaner. The base of the statue, 
	  Fort Wood, is also now visible.
	  
	- The starting technology levels for the Norse have been tuned down to more match the levels of their neighbors. Their 
	  naval shipbuilding technology level will remain the same, however, and they will maintain a very slight military 
	  infantry tech advantage. This is only a temporary solution, as a more in-depth rework of the technology levels is 
	  planned for a later date.
	  
	- The "Disney World" Great Work in Orlando has had its image replaced with one that's cleaner.
	  
	- The Kingdom of Jefferson has had its color changed to a dark green color, to more match its flag.

	  the Chicagoland area, 11 Grangelander dynasties named after notable people from the Quad Cities, and 1 Rostmann 
	  dynasty named after a former president.
	  
	- Added 3 new landmark province modifiers: "The Sacred Lemon Tree" in Sangamon, "The Hallowed Turnip Patch" in West 
	  Okaw, and "The Loop" in Chicago. The first two are references to The Simpsons. "The Loop" will also become a Great 
	  Work in the next update.

	  Thank you, anon 1281614, for this bugfix.

	- Removed the last bit of the Woolleyite Mormon heresy that I missed the last time around.
	- Fixed the Abbot of Herman's Brotherhood (The Nazarene Head of Faith) from going Feudal upon succession. This was 
	  supposed to have been fixed in AtE FF 1.2a, but it wasn't implemented. The Nazarene Head of Faith should now always 
	  be Theocratic.
	- Fixed the High Priest of the Atomic Priesthood (The Aphite Head of Faith) from going Open Range Feudalism (ORF). 
	  The Aphite Head of Faith should now always be Theocratic.
	- Changed the religion of Fraser Littlefield, a previous High Priest of the Atomic Priesthood (The Aphite Head of 
	  Faith) from Atomicist to Aphite, as he was the Aphite High Priest.
	- Commented out a line (true_religion_thelemic_trigger = yes) in 00_societies.txt as it was referencing a non-existent 
	  trigger.
	- Added placeholder event pictures to many events in orf_election_events.txt.
	- Commented out two triggered-only events ("orfelection.23" and "orfelection.24") in orf_election_events.txt as their 
	  trigger in a previous event (An option in "orfelection.4") was already commented out.
	- Fixed two event picture names (In events "fide.125" and "fide.128") in mex_misc.txt. They had the wrong names and 
	  weren't referencing actual pictures.
	- Fixed two event picture names (In events "hanovers.11" and "hanovers.13") in hanover_events.txt. They had the wrong 
	  names and weren't referencing actual pictures.
	- Added placeholder event pictures to two events ("texas.49" and "texas.75") in texas_events.txt as they were missing.
	- Commented out two references to a non-existent trait (party_malcontent) in 01_pragmatist.txt and 04_malcontent.txt.
	- Added a placeholder event picture to event redland.1 in event file redland_events.txt.
	- Changed a line in event "mictlan.10" in file mictlantec_events.txt from "cash = -100" to "wealth = -100", as it was 
	  the wrong command.
	- In the 00_on_actions.txt file, under the on_death section, event "orfelection.102" was commented out as that event 
	  doesn't actually exist.
	- Both references to event "AMLT.1" in the 00_on_actions.txt file were commented out, as that event was already 
	  commented out in am_lt_events.txt.
	- The Mouse artifact "Cursed Apple of the Snow White Princess" had a non-functioning modifier (insane_opinion = 3) 
	  removed. To compensate for this, it now gives 1 Intrigue.
	- Chief Johnathan Nyukem of Esmeralda Pass county now has the "Strong" trait and the "Old World Shades" artifact. He 
	  was also given the "diversity" and "physique" character flags to prevent randomization of his race and physique.
	- Fixed (Maybe?) event "destape.8" in mex_imperial_succession_events.txt.
	- Fixed (Maybe?) event "mictlan.50" in mictlantec_events.txt.
	- Fixed any previous Abbot of Herman's Brotherhood (The Nazarene Head of Faith) from becoming unlanded upon death, 
	  though this comes at a loss of any new Abbot having a dynasty. However, now every new Abbot will start with one of 
	  the three unique Nazarene traits (Seraph, Acolyte and Presbyter). New Abbots will also start about 20 years older, 
	  similar to how they were before. In addition, this fix now allows the Abbot to transfer their wealth and any 
	  artifacts they have to their successor, as previously both their wealth and artifacts disappeared on succession, 
	  leaving their successor with nothing. Also, now Nazarene characters will be notified of the Abbot's death via a 
	  High Priority Message like other Heads of Faith, this was not the case previously for some reason. This fix 
	  involved editing event "nazarene.2" in the file nazarene_events.txt and moving "nazarene.2" in the on_actions.txt 
	  file from the "on_death" section to the "on_new_holder_inheritance" section.
	- Fixed Senor Friedrich of Cuauhtemoc's (Under the Estado of Chihuahua in Sierra Madre) dynasty from Unger to Insbern, 
	  as it was in a previous version. His children now also have the Insbern dynasty, as it used to be. His father is 
	  also now Jeremias Insbern, fixing the Insbern family tree.
	- Cristina Caballero, princess of Baja, has had her ethnicity changed to "Mediterranean", to match the rest of her 
	  family. Her culture is still "Californiano", however.
	- Subprefect Mark Aurelio of Orange county has had his ethnicity changed to "Mediterranean", his culture will remain 
	  "Angeleno", however.
	- Subprefect Arthur Douglas of Oceanside county and his family members have had their ethnicities changed to "White", 
	  while their culture will remain "Angeleno".
	- Subprefect Rock Douglas of Blythe county and his deceased father, Stone Douglas, have had their religion changed to 
	  "Nazarene" to match the religion of their county. They no longer have the cetic trait "Way of the Fist", but now 
	  have the "Wroth" trait in its place. Their ethnicity and culture will remain unchanged.
	- Elizabeth Cameron, the old High Queen of Texas, has been deposed and replaced with George Hillwalker, a reference to 
	  George Dubya, Walker, Texas Ranger, Hank Hill from King of the Hill and General George Hammond (of Texas) from 
	  Stargate SG-1. Thank you, Chilean anon, for the idea of changing his dynasty name from Walker to Hillwalker.
	- All references to the old High Queen in the file am_tex_flavor.csv have been replaced with references to the High 
	  King. Some minor spelling and grammatical errors have also been fixed.
	- The line "princely_elective_apply_elector_setup_effect = yes" in the file empire_decisions.txt has been commented 
	  out, as it was referencing an already commented out section in file 00_scripted_effects.txt. This was under the 
	  "Form Texarkana" decision. It will still give the holder Princely or HRE Elective Succession on creation without it.
	- The "Northlander" culture has had various names restored to it. Thank you, Chilean anon.
	- The "Bagley" dynasty has had its original name restored to "Venable". Thank you, Chilean anon.

	  "Vieux Lions" mercenary company, but will exist alongside them.
	- Fixed a minor spelling error in the "Reunite the Kingdom of Illinois" decision in the file 00_am_events3.csv.
	- Fixed the province of Kaskaskia in the duchy of The Gateway having the wrong name of Kaskasia.
	- The old Kingom of Carolina in the HCC has been restored. However, it can only be formed by decision if you 
	  completely control the duchies under the kingdoms of Tarheel and Palmetto while being independent. This will change 
	  the dejure liege of these duchies to the Kingdom of Carolina, leaving the Kingdoms of Tarheel and Palmetto titular. 
	  Thank you, Chilean anon, for the idea and flag. Thank you, anon 1756033, for the idea of replacing the two old 
	  kingdoms with Carolina as the goal.

	  upgrades have also been moved over to Fort Sumter.

	  removal of the Abbas rulers in Deposed version 0.2.

	- Gave the "Hillwalker" dynasty (The High King of Texas) a modified flag of Texas as their CoA.
	- The barony of Clearwater in Tampa has been activated.
	- Added a new religion: Scientology. It's barebones at the moment, but it now exists. It's a small, hard to convert 
	  and aggressive religion that can raid infidel neighbors for loot. Scientology's Holy Sites are: Riverside, 
	  Los Angeles, San Francisco, Las Vegas and Tampa. Their head of faith is the Chairman of the Board of the Church of 
	  Scientology. With this addition, come characters practicing this religion. There are now 4 landed Scientologists,

	  Travolta, Tony Manero (Saturday Night Fever) and Vincent Vega (Pulp Fiction). He is Gulfard in culture and 
	  Scientologist in religion.
	- With the addition of Scientology comes "Sea Org", Scientology's sole holy order.
	- Added lines for the "Knights of the Golden Circle", "Vieux Lions" (As the line for the "Tonton Macoutes" was left in 
	  here after they were removed everywhere else, but the "Vieux Lions" weren't added here to replace it), and "Sea Org" 
	  to the file HF_alternate_start_events.txt. This only affects Alternate Starts in Shattered or Random worlds.
